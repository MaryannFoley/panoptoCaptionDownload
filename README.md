# Panopto Caption Download

Chrome extension to download the captions for panopto lectures; since you have to use chrome to open the videos might as well get some benefit from it.

Clone this repo, open the chrome "manage extensions" page, turn on developer mode, load unpacked, and link to the repo. When the icon is pressed while a video with available captions is open, the file will be downloaded.
